	Don't forget the snippets in yasnippet-classic-snippets

	* packages/yasnippet-classic-snippets/yasnippet-classic-snippets.el: Add
	'Package-Type: multi'.	Although there is only a single elisp in the top
	directory, we want to include the snippet files (which are the main
	point of this package) in the tarball.

	Fix loading of yasnippet-classic-snippets

	* packages/yasnippet-classic-snippets/yasnippet-classic-snippets.el: 
	Don't require yasnippet.  Handle old single string format of 
	yas-snippet-dirs.  Make sure yasnippet-classic-snippets-dir is actually
	defined when we use it.	 Bump version to 1.0.1.

2018-05-13  Noam Postavsky  <npostavs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* packages/yasnippet: Merge version 0.13.0 from upstream.

	package.
